## LeetCode Starter Problems

Hello, this is a short guide on how to start your journey with LeetCode, as we at Code Chronicles love to help every who asks for it :D.

These problems are picked after trying them ourselves and we believe this can could be beneficial to you all.

We recommend starting out in a language you are comfortable with but we recommend C++ or Java to understand problem-solving and getting used to the habit of coding.

These problems or their problem tag might look or say that it's not an "easy" problem but don't let LeetCode trick you like they did us.
