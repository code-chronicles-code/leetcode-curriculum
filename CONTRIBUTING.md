# GitHub Workflow

Changes to the repository are proposed via GitHub pull requests.

It's recommended to use [GitHub's command-line interface](https://cli.github.com/), as it will simplify the GitHub workflow. Specifically, you can:

1. **Clone this repository directly**, without needing a fork at this point (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/code-chronicles-code/leetcode-curriculum.git`).
2. **Make your changes** on a local branch and commit them (e.g. `git checkout -b some-cool-stuff` and `git commit -am "A descriptive message"`).
3. Use the GitHub CLI to **create a pull request**, by running `gh pr create` and following the prompts. You can let `gh` fork the repository for you and set everything up.

If you prefer not to use the GitHub CLI, you can still create a pull request by any other means you like. Take a look at the GitHub docs on [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and [creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
