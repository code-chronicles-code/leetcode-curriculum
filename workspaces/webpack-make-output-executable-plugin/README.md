# @code-chronicles/webpack-make-output-executable-plugin

A [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) plugin that `chmod`s entry points to be executable files.

## Development

Like the rest of the [Code Chronicles Leetcode ecosystem](../../), this package is structured as a Node module, using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager.

You can install dependencies by running `yarn`, either in this package's directory, or in the repository root. The usual `yarn format`, `yarn lint`, and `yarn typecheck` scripts are available to aid in development and occasionally to annoy.

See also the repository's general [development guide](../../DEVELOPMENT.md).
