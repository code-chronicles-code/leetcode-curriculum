# 2677. Chunk Array

[View Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/chunk-array/)

Although the problem asks us not to use [`_.chunk`](https://lodash.com/docs/#chunk), I think there's no harm in using it to get a quick accept, as long as we then follow up with another strategy.

As far as manual implementations, the choice is likely between traversing the input one element at a time, or grabbing a larger _slice_ of input at once. Both approaches are viable and can result in an efficient solution.
