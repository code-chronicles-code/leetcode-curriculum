# 2634. Filter Elements from Array

[View Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/filter-elements-from-array/)

This is one of many problems that essentially ask us to implement some built-in JavaScript function. Here, we're asked to implement filtering without using [`.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), so of course the first thing we should do is get accepted using `.filter`!

For a more serious solution, a loop that builds the result works just fine.

One more thing worth practicing is implementing `.filter` using [`.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). Since pretty much anything can be done through `.reduce`, it was at one point popular in interviews to ask candidates to build some other operation without explicit loops, instead using only `.reduce`.
