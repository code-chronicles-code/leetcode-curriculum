# 2635. Apply Transform Over Each Element in Array

[View Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-transform-over-each-element-in-array/)

We're about to get into a bunch of problems that essentially ask us to implement some built-in JavaScript function. This problem is asking us to implement mapping without using [`.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), so of course the first thing we should do is get accepted using `.map`!

For a more serious solution, we can keep it simple with some kind of loop that builds the result.

One more thing worth practicing is implementing `.map` using [`.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). Since pretty much anything can be done through `.reduce`, it was at one point popular in interviews to ask candidates to build some other operation without explicit loops, instead using only `.reduce`.

It's also possible to consider other built-in functions. For example, LeetCode didn't ask us not to use [`.flatMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flatMap)!
