# 2726. Calculator with Method Chaining

[View Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculator-with-method-chaining/)

This problem introduces JavaScript classes, by asking us to implement a simple class that holds one value. The code structure will be similar to classes in Java, C++, and even Python.

We'll also have to support "method chaining", which is a fancy way of saying that we shouldn't have any `void` methods, but rather `return this` from all of our mutating methods.
