    # Scheduled GitHub Actions seem to be consistently delayed... So this is
    # a bit of a hack to kick off this workflow an hour early. If it runs
    # before the new problem of the day is available, it will simply sleep
    # until it is. And since we only post once per day thanks to the cache,
    # this shouldn't result in any duplicate posts.
