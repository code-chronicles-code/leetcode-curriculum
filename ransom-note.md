Hi friends! The REPLACE WITH DAY OF WEEK problem is [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/). We have live discussions at **8-8:15am**, **7-7:15pm**, and **9:30-9:45pm** (all times California time) for anyone who wants to discuss or see the problem solved live.

* **Baseline goal**: Get accepted in any way at all! Hint: ||one way to solve it would be for each character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" count whether it occurs more times in the magazine than in the ransom note||.
* **Stretch goal**: Iterate only once over `ransomNote` and only once over `magazine`. If your language has built-in libraries for character counting try a version of the solution that doesn't use them.

I look forward to seeing your solutions!
