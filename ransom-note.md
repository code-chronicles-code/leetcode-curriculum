# Thread Template

Hi friends! The REPLACE WITH DAY OF WEEK problem is [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/). We have live discussions at **8-8:15am**, **7-7:15pm**, and **9:30-9:45pm** (all times California time) for anyone who wants to discuss or see the problem solved live.

* **Baseline goal**: Get accepted in any way at all! Hint: ||one way to solve it would be for each character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" count whether it occurs more times in the magazine than in the ransom note||.
* **Stretch goal**: Iterate only once over `ransomNote` and only once over `magazine`. If your language has built-in libraries for character counting try a version of the solution that doesn't use them.

I look forward to seeing your solutions!

# Notes for Facilitators

## Checklist for a good session:

* controlled the clock
  * started on time
  * ended on time
* fostered a positive learning environment
  * led the discussion with enthusiasm
  * involved the audience
  * confirmed that people understand the code being shown
* covered the solution using 26 iterations through the inputs
  * encouraged the audience to consider hacky solutions when they can't think of something better
  * mentioned that 26 times the size of the inputs is still small enough to be only "millions" of operations, so it's good enough to get accepted
* covered the solution using frequency map, only using one iteration
  * explained how to avoid if statements for setting up the frequency map, for example `freq.get(c, 0)` in Python, `(freq[c] ?? 0)` in JavaScript, and `freq.getOrDefault(c, 0)` in Java

Bonus points:

* got at least 2 people to share their code during the session
* explained that we can use an array of size 26 for the frequencies
  * if time, got someone to actually code this solution, but at a bare minimum showed a solution and shared a link to it
* showed built-ins such as Python's `Counter` or Ruby's `.tally` as a way to quickly get frequency maps
