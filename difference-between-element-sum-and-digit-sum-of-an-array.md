Hi friends! The REPLACE WITH DAY OF WEEK problem is [2535. Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/difference-between-element-sum-and-digit-sum-of-an-array/). We have live discussions at **8-8:15am**, **7-7:15pm**, and **9:30-9:45pm** (all times California time) for anyone who wants to discuss or see the problem solved live.

* **Baseline goal**: Get accepted in any way at all!
* **Stretch goal**: Practice two ways of getting the digits of the number -- by converting to a string and getting the digits as characters, and another way without converting to a string, but grabbing the digits numerically.
* **Stretch stretch goal**:  use the `yield` keyword to solve the problem if your language supports it. (And if not, the pro move would be to use a language that does for this problem, e.g. JavaScript or Python.)

I look forward to seeing your solutions!
