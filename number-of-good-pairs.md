Hi friends! The REPLACE WITH DAY OF WEEK problem is [1512. Number of Good Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/). We have live discussions at **8-8:15am**, **7-7:15pm**, and **9:30-9:45pm** (all times California time) for anyone who wants to discuss or see the problem solved live.

* **Baseline goal**: Get accepted in any way at all!
* **Stretch goal**: Do it with a better time complexity than O(n^2).
* **Stretch stretch goal**: Incorporate [the "number of handshakes" formula](https://www.brightstorm.com/math/geometry/reasoning-diagonals-angles-and-parallel-lines/number-of-handshakes-at-a-party-problem-1/) into your solution!

I look forward to seeing your solutions!
