# Thread Template

Hi friends! The REPLACE WITH DAY OF WEEK problem is [1512. Number of Good Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/). We have live discussions at **8-8:15am**, **7-7:15pm**, and **9:30-9:45pm** (all times California time) for anyone who wants to discuss or see the problem solved live.

* **Baseline goal**: Get accepted in any way at all!
* **Stretch goal**: Do it with a better time complexity than O(n^2).
* **Stretch stretch goal**: Incorporate [the "number of handshakes" formula](https://www.brightstorm.com/math/geometry/reasoning-diagonals-angles-and-parallel-lines/number-of-handshakes-at-a-party-problem-1/) into your solution!

I look forward to seeing your solutions!

 # Notes for Facilitators

## Checklist for a good session:

* controlled the clock
  * started on time
  * ended on time
* fostered a positive learning environment
  * led the discussion with enthusiasm
  * involved the audience
  * confirmed that people understand the code being shown
* covered the brute force solution
  * explained how to look at the problem constraints and take an educated guess regarding whether a particular time complexity will be good enough to get accepted (i.e. the "millions of operations" heuristic)
* covered the solution that uses a frequency map along the way
  * went over a specific example by hand, in detail, to show why this works
  * encouraged people to print more often in their code
* showed a solution using the handshake formula
  * if time, modified the code from the previous frequency map solution, if not enough time at least showed a complete solution and encouraged people to research it further

## Bonus points:

* got at least 2 people to share their code during the session
* discussed the handshake formula in-depth
  * showed with some small examples that the formula works
  * explained an inituitive derivation, for example: if you have N people, each one shakes hands with N - 1 others, but that counted the handshake between person A and person B twice, for both person A and person B (and this is true for all handshakes) so we have to divide by 2
  * asked somebody in the audience how many handshakes we'd have with 10 people
* showed built-ins such as Python's `Counter` or Ruby's `.tally` as a way to quickly get frequency maps
